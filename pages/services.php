<p>Easy-to-use Talon Analytics software actually requires very little training&lt;<strong><u> hyperlink to another page&gt;</u></strong> <br>
  Since the <strong><em>Talon Knowledge Engine &nbsp;</em></strong>is designed specifically to targeted business users who are engaged in solving well-defined, industry-specific problems, the end-user training regimen is amazingly simple, straightforward, and not all that time-consuming. In a matter of hours and days, Talon’s training programs will get your end-users familiar with the full range of dashboards, scorecards, models, reports, and data drill-down capabilities included in Talon Analytics software. <br>
  Since there is no technology to deploy on site, the only customer-side IT support required is an encrypted VPN or secure socket layer Internet (tunnel) connection, an industry-standard web browser, and OS support for a downloadable mobile app, or laptop or PC desktop app.<br>
  We look forward to you contacting Talon soon to discuss your organization's Analytics needs.</p>
