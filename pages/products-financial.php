            <h2>Talon Knowledge Engine for Financial Services <hyperlink to another page></h2>
            <p>Now especially, more than ever, financial services firms ranging from banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and hedge funds, need to optimize their product portfolios, and better target products for customers based on their demographic and psychographic characteristics, and their financial goals, objectives, and level of risk aversion.  Financial and economic research firms must also target the consumers of their products, namely investment management firms, based upon their needs, requirements, and specific investment domains, e.g., stocks, bonds, commodities.</p>  
            <p><strong>Marketing Analytics</strong> – Leveraging historical data on customer purchasing history, demographic/psychographic/behavioral characteristics, we employ statistical models to group customers into market classes or segments, and then predict the likelihood that a given customer will opt to purchase a particular product; that information can be used to prioritize marketing and sales efforts, target market products, test marketing message effectiveness, and then measure the effectiveness and ROI of marketing campaigns.  Specifically, we employ the following methods and techniques:</p>

            </ul>
            <h2>Product Line Pricing, Profitability, & <br />ROI Measurement & Optimization –</h2> 
            <p>Optimized product (line) pricing begins with an in-depth understanding of customer demand patterns, competition pricing, and the capacity to produce, manage, and distribute product inventory---classic supply and demand economic principles,  whose application is modernized with greater amounts of more timely data, faster and less expensive computing power, and more sophisticated analytical tools.  Product line profitability and ROI measurement and optimization are crucial to a healthy bottom line.</p>  
            <p>Analytics is key to both measuring and optimizing the profitability and ROI of an entire product portfolio by ensuring that resources are allocated to and invested in the most profitable projects and product (line) endeavors, and less than profitable products are discontinued accordingly.  Specifically, we employ the following methods and techniques:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Demand Forecasting</li>   
              <li>Customer Segmentation Analysis</li>     
              <li>Product (Line) Utility Stratification & Segmentation</li>
              <li>Product (Line) Bundling & (Tiered, Variable) Pricing</li>    
              <li>Optimized Product Inventory Allocation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Optimized customer segmentation and product (line) segmentation and utility stratification, leading to maximized revenue</li>
              <li>Optimized product bundling and tiered and variable pricing, leading to maximized revenue</li>
              <li>Optimized product (line) inventory allocation and portfolio profitability & ROI, leading to maximized net profit and ROI</li>
              <li>Optimized productive resource capacity allocation among only profitable product (lines), leading to maximized net profit</li>
