            <h2>Talon Knowledge Engine for Retail</h2>
            <p>Analytics can provide the type of insight into the customer’s behavior that can make the difference between increasing sales and losing sales, and deepening the relationship with your most loyal and profitable repeat customers.  According to a recent McKinsey study, retailers who maximize the use of data analytics can improve their operating margins by 60%.</p>
            <p>Marketing Analytics  –  we employ statistical models to group customers into market classes or segments, and then predict the likelihood that a given customer will opt to purchase a particular product; that information can be used to prioritize marketing and sales efforts, target market products, test marketing message effectiveness, and then measure the effectiveness and ROI of marketing campaigns.  Specifically, we employ the following methods and techniques:</p>

            <h3>Product Line Pricing, Profitability, & ROI Measurement & Optimization</h3>  
            <p>– Optimized product (line) pricing begins with an in-depth understanding of customer demand patterns, competition pricing, and the capacity to produce, manage, and distribute product inventory---classic supply and demand economic principles,  whose application is modernized with greater amounts of more timely data, faster and less expensive computing power, and more sophisticated analytical tools.</p>  
            <p>Analytics is key to both measuring and optimizing the profitability and ROI of an entire product portfolio by ensuring that resources are allocated to and invested in the most profitable projects and product (line) endeavors, and less than profitable products are discontinued accordingly.  Specifically, we employ the following methods and techniques:</p>
