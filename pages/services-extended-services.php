            <h2 id="training">Training</h2>
            <p>Easy-to-use Cobalt Talon analytics software actually requires very little training</p>
            <p>Since the <a href="/products/how-it-works"><strong><em>Cobalt Talon Analytics Platform</em></strong></a> is designed specifically to targeted business users who are engaged in solving well-defined, industry-specific problems, the end-user training regimen is amazingly simple, straightforward, and not all that time-consuming. In a matter of hours and days, Cobalt Talon’s training programs will get your end-users familiar with the full range of dashboards, scorecards, models, reports, and data drill-down capabilities included in Cobalt Talon analytics software.</p>
            <p>Since there is no technology to deploy on site, the only customer-side IT support required is an encrypted VPN or secure socket layer Internet (tunnel) connection, an industry-standard web browser, and OS support for a downloadable mobile app, or laptop or PC desktop app.</p>
            <p>We look forward to you contacting Cobalt Talon soon to discuss your organization's analytics needs.</p>
