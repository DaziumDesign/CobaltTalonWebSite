<h2>Talon Knowledge Engine&#8482; for <br /> Telecommunications & Mobile <hyperlink to another page></h2>
<img class="thumb_right" src="/images/products/telecomm.jpg" />
<p>Telecommunications and Mobile carriers are highly motivated to understand as much as possible about their customers’ phone usage patterns, purchasing habits, demographic characteristics, and psychographic interests to better target products, services, and advertisements to customers on a one-to-one marketing, individualized basis, and increase sales revenue and profits.</p>  

<p>Analytics can provide the type of insight into the customer’s behavior that can make the difference between increasing sales and losing sales, and deepening the relationship with your most loyal and profitable repeat customers</p>
<p>Marketing Analytics– Leveraging historical data on customer mobile phone usage patterns, purchasing history, demographic/psychographic/behavioral characteristics, we employ statistical models to group customers into market classes or segments, and then predict the likelihood that a given customer will opt to purchase a particular product; that information can be used to prioritize marketing and sales efforts, target market products, test marketing message effectiveness, and then measure the effectiveness and ROI of marketing campaigns.  Specifically, we employ the following methods and techniques:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customer Segmentation Analysis</li>
  <li>Affinity Analysis for Market Basket (Cross-selling, Up-selling)</li>
  <li>Propensity to Consume Scoring and Prediction</li>
  <li>POS Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Targeted Advertising & Product Marketing & Customer Acquisition</li> 
  <li>A/B Testing for Landing Page and Email Design, and Marketing Messages</li>
  <li>Marketing Campaign Effectiveness & ROI Measurement</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Getting the right product (or service), to the right customer, at the right time, with the right marketing message, through the right communications media channel</li>
  <li>Optimizing marketing spend efficiency by only targeting those customers with a sufficiently high propensity to consume a given product or service, e.g., phone plans, ring tones, video, retail goods</li>
  <li>Maximizing marketing campaign ROI</li>
  <li>Increased sales revenue and profitability</li>
</ul>
<p>Product Line Pricing, Profitability, & ROI Measurement & Optimization – Optimized product (line) pricing begins with an in-depth understanding of customer demand patterns, competition pricing, and the capacity to produce, manage, and distribute product inventory---classic supply and demand economic principles,  whose application is modernized with greater amounts of more timely data, faster and less expensive computing power, and more sophisticated analytical tools.  Product line profitability and ROI measurement and optimization are crucial to a healthy bottom line.</p>  


Analytics is key to both measuring and optimizing the profitability and ROI of an entire product portfolio by ensuring that resources are allocated to and invested in the most profitable projects and product (line) endeavors, and less than profitable products are discontinued accordingly.  Specifically, we employ:
<ul>
  <li>Product (Line) Utility Stratification & Segmentation</li>   
  <li>Customer Segmentation Analysis</li>       
  <li>Demand Forecasting</li>
  <li>Product (Line) Bundling & (Tiered, Variable) Pricing</li>     
  <li>Optimized Product Inventory Allocation</li>
</ul>


<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Optimized customer segmentation and product (line) segmentation and utility stratification, leading to maximized revenue</li>
  <li>Optimized product bundling and tiered and variable pricing, leading to maximized revenue</li>
  <li>Optimized product (line) inventory allocation and portfolio profitability & ROI, leading to maximized net profit and ROI</li>
  <li>Optimized productive resource capacity allocation among only profitable product (lines), leading to maximized net profit</li>
</ul>
